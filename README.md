### Development plans

Features to be added
* GPX upload for routes
* FMI weather forecast data retrieval. This is actually already implemented, but it does not work in the shinyapps.io service. I am considering to setup Shiny on the okf.fi server, which would solve this problem.
* Weather forecast visualization improvements
 * Show more data
 * Show sunset time
